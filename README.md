Fullstack springboot/angular web application designed to log a companies employee data. Provides 4 different roles to a user with different authorities, sending email for resetting a users password, and my first time implementing brute force security for a web application. Using JWT and Spring Security while also implementing MariaDB.

Feel free to interact with the application to see different functionality that was provided and to get a feel for the app. Currently in the proccess of creating a google workspace account so I can give the IP a correct domain name & to have the reset email functionality fully functional given google has a lot of security restraints.
