JWT (JSON WEB TOKEN):
Has become the standard when authenticating and authorizing users using restful web services.
    Contains 3 Main Parts:
        Header - Contains an "algorithm" that is used for the cryptographic (used to encrypt things) & also the "type". If using JWT, the type
        will always be JWT.

        Payload - Contains all of the user or the subject information. Can contain a user name, time the token was issued
        or the different permissions a user is granted.

        Signature - Is a 256 bit-secret(random string) which is used to encrypt all of the information and is very important to the application.
        (Should keep it very secure)

        The entire token when is seperated in these 3 parts by periods.
            Ex: eyJhGciJIUzI1NilslnR5cCI6IKpXVCJ9(header).
            eyJzdWLiOilxMjM0NTY3ODkwliwibmFtZSII6IkpvaG4RG9LlliwiajdfhbdjksaHJFDKla(Payload).

        JWT token is just a very secure way of transmitting data from one application to another and because it's sp secure and compact it's being used a lot in restful applications.
